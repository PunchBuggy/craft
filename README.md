This repository is a fork of the official [Craft CMS starter project](https://github.com/craftcms/craft), acting as a bootstrap template. If you've not used Craft before, I would recommend using the official repository, as this repo is quite opinionated on several structural decisions.

## Getting started

You will need [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to follow these instructions.

1. Configure an SQL database for the site to connect to.
2. Create the project. This will take a few minutes while it pulls down all the dependencies it requires:

        composer create-project -n punchbuggy/craft <path>

    Replace `<path>` with the path to the project folder, or `.` if you would like to use the current folder.

3. Configure the site to connect to the DB set up in step 1. You can do this by visiting `/admin` in a web browser, or running `./craft setup` in your terminal.
4. Hydrate the rest of the system with the following commands:

        ./craft migrate
        ./craft schematic/import --force
